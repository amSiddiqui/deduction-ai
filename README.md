# Deduction: An AI Reasoning Challenge Game

Welcome to Deduction, a project designed to explore and showcase the differences in reasoning capabilities between various AI language models.

## Project Overview

Deduction is an interactive puzzle-solving game where users engage with challenges that require logical deduction and reasoning. The game allows interaction with different AI models, providing a platform to observe and compare how "traditional" language models approach these problems versus newer models specifically honed for advanced reasoning.

## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project is to provide a hands-on experience demonstrating how different types of AI models, particularly those with enhanced reasoning abilities, tackle complex problems. By solving puzzles with the assistance of these distinct AI agents, users can gain insights into their varying problem-solving strategies, strengths, and limitations in the context of reasoning tasks.

## Project Structure

This repository contains two main components:

* **`/deduction-api`**: The backend service built with FastAPI (Python). It manages game logic, user sessions, puzzle progression, and interfaces with the AI models. See the `deduction-api/README.md` for setup and details.
* **`/deduction-ui`**: The frontend user interface built with React (TypeScript). It provides the interactive game experience for users. See the `deduction-ui/README.md` for setup and details.

## Getting Started

To run the full application, you will need to set up and run both the API backend and the UI frontend. Please refer to the README files within each respective directory (`/deduction-api` and `/deduction-ui`) for detailed setup and execution instructions.
